"""
Most modern web applications are powered by a REST API under the hood. That way,
developers can separate the front-end code from the back-end logic, and users can interact with the interface dynamically.

-> render_template() is indeed used to return HTML pages dynamically by rendering templates.
-> redirect is commonly used for redirecting users to another page or endpoint after submitting a form or performing some action.
-> url_for() is used to generate URLs for different routes or endpoints in your Flask application,
    allowing you to maintain flexibility and consistency in your code.

->To send the API request, we need an HTTP method. Some commonly used methods are POST, GET, DELETE, PUT, and PATCH.

    ->GET: This HTTP method is used to access the data from an API.
    ->POST: This method transmits new data.
    ->DELETE: This is used to remove or delete the existing data.
    ->PATCH: This method is used to update the existing data.
    ->PUT: This method is used to update the existing data.
