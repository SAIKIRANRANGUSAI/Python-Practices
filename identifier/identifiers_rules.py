            -> name given to the entity
 Rules:
   -> Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
   -> Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
   -> Cannot be a Python keyword.
   -> Cannot contain special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc. (except underscore).

    Using meaningful and descriptive identifiers makes your code more readable, maintainable,
