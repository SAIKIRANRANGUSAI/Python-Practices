"""
    Abstraction:  abstraction is the process of hiding the implementaion deteils from user.
    -> Abstraion is actually finding which functionality is hidden from the user
       and which is shown to user (allowing them to focus on the essential features rather than the internal)
    -> It works in design phase
    -> abstracion methods are usefull blueprints that ensure that we don't foget to implement methods
        from a class and they are usefull because they really help us to stay comsistence.
    -> we should import abc and abstractmethos and in class inherate abc
    -> In function use decorator like @abstractmethod
By using abstraction, developers can create clear and consistent interfaces,
 making it easier for users to understand and interact with the system
