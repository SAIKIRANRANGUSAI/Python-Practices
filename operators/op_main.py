"""
    Operators: operators are special symboles used in many ways like used in conditional statements
                used in loops  mainly used in calulation ans also for logicaal perpose.

        Operators are classisfied into 8 types:
            -> Arithmetic(+ , -, *, /, //, %, **)
                    if  we use operators in () theit wil run first or calculate first then
                    multiplcation and division have same prefreance  next addtion and sub have

                    ex: 20+(20+4)/ (2*3)
                        20+24/6
                        20+4
                        =24

            -> logical (AND, OR, NOT)
            -> Comparison(==, !=, <=, >=, <, >)
            -> Assignment(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=)
            -> Bitwise(&, |, ~ ,)
            -> membership( in , not in) - memory
            -> identity (is , not is)
            Complex class in Python doesn't support the modulus operator (%) and floor division operator (//).
