"""
    Tuples is a collection of data items of different data types
    which is ordered and unchangeable(immutable) allows dublicate.
    -> for empty tuples just used () pantatis but for single item use , (44,)
    ->To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or
      indices to obtain value available at that index. For example
        tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
        tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )
        print "tup1[0]: ", tup1[0]
        print "tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5]
    -> Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements.
     but you can add two tuples
     -> we can delete a tuple by 'del' keyword but after deleting we can't see the tuple
     -> can't delete items or values in tuple but we can delete entire tuple.
     -> slicing and indexing is possible same as a list.
     -> if we not specify pantasis or square brazes then default it will be tuple
            sai = 'sai',"kiran","rangu",1,3,54,56,7
        now sai is a tuple by default
    -> we can convert list to tuple and dict and also string to tuple by using tuple()
            s = tuple(a)
    -> tuple is immutable we can't update values if we update then we get typeError.
    -> if you want to update tuple then convert into list and update and convert into tuple
       but after converting into tuple the id will change that means new tuple is created existing tuple remain same.
   -> unpacking - sai = (1,2,3)
                 x,y,z = sai # x = 1, y = 2, z = 3
    -> count is used to find the occurance sai.count("sai")
    -> methods used = del,update,+,*
