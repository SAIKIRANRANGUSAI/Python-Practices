"""
    string (str) : a string is a sequence of characters its is immutable(can't change) but we can replace
    if you want to update string then convert string into list and update and then convert back
     if we want to create string then use '' or "" or ''' '''
        string can be enclosed in either single quotes(' ') or double(" ") or thrible(''' ''').
            -> use single or double quotes for single line string
            -> for multiline string use thruble(''' ''')

        -> use uppercase letter for Constrants(unique value Should not change) but in python we can change.
              -> conatrants should not overwrite
        -> slicing(start,end,step)
        -> len() starts with 1

      The .casefold() method returns a copy of a string with all characters in lowercase. It is similar to .lower(),
      but whereas that method deals purely with ASCII text, .casefold() can also convert Unicode characters.

  Methods used in string:
  -> upper, lowerh
  ->patition- saparte in string (line 45)
  ->rstrip, split - split done in list format
  ->replace(replace by value)
  -> index(raise error exception if not found), find(if not found then return -1),Both of them return the starting index of the substring in a string if it exists
  isnumeric(check if it is numeric or not)

        python does't have char.
