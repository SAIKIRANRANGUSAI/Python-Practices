"""
    Generator:a generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over.
        -> Generators are useful when we want to produce a large sequence of values,
            but we don't want to store all of them in memory at once.
        -> The "yield" keyword is used to produce a value from the generator
            and pause the generator function's execution until the next value is requested
        -> we can also print al values with using for loop or using next(sai)
        ->  Generator Expression: same as list comparison but insted of creating new list it will create
          generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values in the generator.
